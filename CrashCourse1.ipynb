According to the website https://www.python.org/ it \"lets you work quickly and integrate systems effectively.\"\n","\n","Python has a number of features, such as easy to read code, which make it an excellent choice for novice programmers.  It is also easy for experienced programmers to learn Python since it is a very flexible language, supporting, for example, both the object-oriented paradigm familiar to Java programmers and the functional programming paradigm familiar to Lisp and Haskell programmers.  There are also a vast number of libraries (or toolboxes) which  make it easier to carry out complex tasks without constantly reinventing the wheel.  Popular Python libraries for Data Scientists include NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Pandas and Scikit-Learn.  These libraries include functionality for statistical calculations, linear algebra, graph plotting, machine learning and much much more.\n","\n","## Using Python\n","\n","For this module you may use either Jupyter Notebook (for computing on your machine) or Google Colaboratory (for computing in the cloud, https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).\n","\n","The *ipython notebook* (ipynb) files (programs) that will be used can run on both of these interfaces.\n","\n","Jupyter Notebook is part of the Anaconda toolkit.  To download and install Anaconda, go here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual\n","\n","Python is an interpreted language.  This means that instructions are executed directly on a processor or *Kernel*, without the set of instructions previously being compiled into machine-language instructions.\n","\n","We interact with the Kernel through a programming environment.  There are many good programming environments - however, here we will use Jupyter Notebooks / Google Colaboratory, which make it easy to collect code, output and discussion into a single file.  \n","\n","## ipython notebooks - Basics\n","\n","Blocks of code or text in a ipython notebook are referred to as *cells*.  Use the *Insert* menu to insert new cells and the *Cell* menu to run cells and change their type.  The current cell can also be run by pressing \"Shift+Enter\".\n","\n","This is a *text* cell.  Text can be formatted using Markdown.  When a text cell is run, the formatting is applied. Code cells contain instructions for the Kernel.  When a code cell is run the output or result of running the set of instructions is displayed below.\n","\n","Try running the code in the cell below.
